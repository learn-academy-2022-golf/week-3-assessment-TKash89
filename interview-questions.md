# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: 
                JSX, in my opinion, is like a "hybrid language" that is used in REACT. React is the facebook/meta created javascript library used to build singular page applications on the web. A significant syntax difference between these two is that JSX allows javascript to be written along side HTML in a file. Without this you would be required to use seperate files, then link them together.

Researched answer:
                JSX is the language used in React meaning Javascript XML, or Javascript Syntax Extension. It combines the features of both Javascript and HTML languages, using components instead of completely seperate files in order to efficiently use react software. The difference between HTML and JSX is that when writting HTML, you are not required to return a single parent element. Using JSX, returning a parent element is needed or else it will not compile. On another note, one last difference is that you cannot write any JS code in HTML, unless you properly place a script tag linking them together. In JSX you are free to travel to Javascript land anytime of your choosing.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer:
                To the best of my knowledge, yarn is software containing many nodes and snippets that provide tools for React, and to an extent, Jest. I'm honestly not comfortable with the exact nomenclature, however, I'd like to take the liberty and research more about yarn, to provide a much better answer.

Researched answer:
                Yarn is large and relitively new package manager that was created to facilitate avoiding the rewriting of common pieces of code. In collaboration between Tilde, Google, and Exponent, it is an open source package manager in which engineers have shared thousands of snippets of code. This has enabled developers access to over 300,000 packages.

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer:
                An anonymous function in JavaScript is best summarized by an example: I understand that an anonymous function is the basic syntax of a function, minus the argument and a return. The primary example I'm thinking of is in a higher order function, such as .map or .filter. These both utilize an anonymous function in their code.

Researched answer:
                An anonymous function in JavaScript, the function keyword itself is used only, without a function name. These anon. functions can also accept more than one inputs and one return output. These can also be invoked immediately, and used as an argument towards other functions.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: 
                In React, state values act as storage to be called upon. Props, or "properties", are a way using JSX to kind of tag code in components to the main App.js file.

Researched answer:
                The properties within React are basically the arguments that are getting passed into the individual React components. This is very similar to how with regular functions, arguments get passed through. The state values in React is a structure that contains data about a component. These state values are able to be changed over time. Also, state is only managed in the component, where as props are passed towards it.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: 
                Unfortunetly, this question has got the best of me! I'm having a difficult time stating the exact definition. That being said, I am more than happy to give a conceptual explaining the best I can: The DOM, which is an acronym, is the visual display that appears from the written React JSX code. This is where the user interface would be.

Researched answer:
                I was off on my summarization regarding what DOM means. The DOM stands for document object model, and you can think of it as a tree structure that represents the web page itself. This is incredibly useful when building a web page in React because it allows the designer to change content in Javascript easier than sifting through code. Anytime there are changes in React, it updates the DOM as well. 

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer:
                The <div> in HTML separates code block, headers, etc. Span on the other hand I am not too familiar with.
Researched answer:
                <Div> is an HTML element that is used to divide such things as headings, paragraphs, photographs, link to other websites into blocks. These particular blocks have equal width towards the whole page. <Divs> are different from <span> because even though both are HTML elements and separate content, <span> is primarily used for smaller pieces of photos, other elements, and text. It's width is thin compared to <div>.
## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming:
                Object-oriented programming is a technique of writing code that enables the user to make other object from a common object.

2. Ruby:
                This is an open source scripting programming language which was invented my Yukihiro Matsumoto to deliver a language that wasn't "simple", but "natural". This is an object-oriented language with easier syntax solve problems handling data and logic.

3. Implicit return:
                An implicit return is when there is a funtion returned with no keyword of "return". Function values are able to be returned by throwing away the regular curly braces if there is a single expression.

4. Ruby blocks:
                In the Ruby programming language, ruby blocks are anon. functions that are able to be passed into methods, and can also contain more than one argument.

5. Ruby hashes:
                These contain key value pairs that almost mimic an array. Ruby hashes have many built in methods and are indexed not by the known integer, but by keys of any object type.
